# Git and GitHub Conventions

## Commits

Follow guidelines from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Specifically, begin each commit with one of the following types:

```
build:
ci:
chore:
docs:
feat:
fix:
perf:
refactor:
revert:
style:
test:
```

See some real examples in our [commit history](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/commits/master).

## Issues

Please create issues using [our templates](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new/choose). However, you will almost certainly get feedback and help faster in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!

## Pull Requests

If your PR is related to other issue(s), reference it by issue number. You can close issues smoothly with [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords):

```
close #1
fix #2
resolve #2
```

This repo only allows those with merge permissions to "Squash and Merge" PRs. This makes reverts easier if they are needed.
