# About Athens


## What is Athens

Athens is an open-source knowledge graph. The initial use cases for Athens today in the personal context are: note-taking, journaling, documentation, and research.

In a collaborative context, Athens is great for teams to capture a vast amount of knowledge, notice patterns across a breadth and depth of information, and synthesize and apply it to various contexts. Ideal users include user reseachers and product managers, high-tech researchers (e.g. AI, biotech, pharmaceuticals, hardware, cryptography), and academics.

Athens does this as an outliner with bidirectional links and block references that let users easily reference pages and atomic blocks of thought, reusing and composing ideas across contexts and disciplines.

## Mission

Athens' mission is to enable individuals, organizations, and communities to solve complex problem through transforming information to insight, reducing coordination cost, and leveraging the collective intelligence of networks and marketplaces.
